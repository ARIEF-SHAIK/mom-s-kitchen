        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>1 cup semolina (rava/suji)
            2 cups water
            2 tbsp oil or ghee
            1 tsp mustard seeds
            1 tsp urad dal (split black gram)
            1 tsp chana dal (optional)
            1-2 green chilies, chopped
            1 small onion, finely chopped
            1/2 inch ginger, grated (optional)
            8-10 curry leaves
            Salt to taste
            Freshly chopped coriander leaves for garnish
            Lemon juice (optional)
            A handful of roasted cashews or peanuts (optional)
            Optional Vegetables (for added nutrition and flavor)
            1/4 cup carrots, diced
            1/4 cup peas
            1/4 cup bell peppers, diced
            </p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p> Roast the Semolina: Dry roast the semolina in a pan on low heat until it turns light golden and aromatic. Set aside to cool.

            Heat Oil and Temper Spices: In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add urad dal and chana dal, and sauté until golden.
            
            Add Aromatics: Add chopped green chilies, curry leaves, and ginger. Sauté for a few seconds, then add the chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent.
            
            Add Vegetables (if using): Add carrots, peas, and bell peppers. Cook for a few minutes until they’re slightly tender.
            
            Add Water and Salt: Pour in water, and add salt to taste. Bring it to a boil.
            
            Slowly Add Semolina: Lower the heat, then gradually add the roasted semolina while stirring continuously. This prevents lumps from forming.
            
            Cook the Upma: Stir until the water is absorbed and the mixture thickens. Cover the pan and cook on low heat for 2-3 minutes.
            
            Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat. Add lemon juice, roasted cashews or peanuts, and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
            
            Serving Suggestion
            Serve hot with coconut chutney or a dollop of yogurt for extra flavor.
            
            Enjoy your delicious homemade upma!</p>

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>Ingredients
            1 cup whole wheat flour
            1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)
            1/4 cup water (adjust as needed)
            1-2 tsp oil or ghee (for the dough)
            Oil for deep frying
            </p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process : </h3>
        <p>Instructions
            1. Prepare the Dough
            In a mixing bowl, add the wheat flour and salt.
            Add a few teaspoons of oil or ghee to the flour. This helps make the puris soft.
            Gradually add water and knead into a firm, smooth dough. The dough should be slightly stiffer than regular roti dough, as this helps puris puff up while frying.
            Cover the dough and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes.
            2. Roll the Puris
            Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a marble.
            Roll each ball into a small circle (3-4 inches in diameter) on a lightly greased or floured surface. Keep them slightly thick, as thin puris won’t puff up well.
            Roll all puris before you start frying, and keep them covered to prevent drying out.
            3. Fry the Puris
            Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. To check if it’s hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the oil; it should rise to the surface quickly.
            Gently slide a rolled puri into the hot oil. As it starts to puff up, lightly press on it with a slotted spoon to help it puff completely.
            Flip the puri and fry until both sides are golden brown. This should only take about 30 seconds per side if the oil is hot enough.
            Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
            4. Serve
            Serve hot with a side of aloo bhaji, chole, or any curry of your choice.
            
            Tips
            Make sure the oil is hot enough; if it’s not, the puris will absorb too much oil and won’t puff up.
            Roll the puris evenly for uniform puffing.
            Enjoy your fluffy, delicious puris!</p>

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>
            1 cup idli rice (or parboiled rice)
            1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)
            1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (optional, for flavor and fermentation)
            Salt to taste
            Water (as needed)
            </p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>1. Soak the Ingredients
            Rinse the rice and urad dal separately in water.
            Soak the rice in a bowl and the urad dal with fenugreek seeds (if using) in another bowl. Let them soak for 4-6 hours.
            2. Grind the Batter
            Drain the soaked urad dal and grind it in a blender or wet grinder until smooth and fluffy. Add water as needed to achieve a smooth consistency.
            Grind the soaked rice to a slightly coarse batter, adding water gradually. The texture should be similar to semolina or fine sand.
            Mix the rice and urad dal batters in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.
            3. Ferment the Batter
            Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become airy and slightly bubbly.
            4. Prepare for Steaming
            After fermentation, gently stir the batter. If it’s too thick, add a bit of water to achieve a thick, pourable consistency.
            Grease idli molds lightly with oil and pour the batter into each mold, filling them about 3/4 full.
            5. Steam the Idlis
            Heat water in a steamer or pressure cooker. Place the idli stand in the steamer, cover with a lid (do not use the weight if using a pressure cooker), and steam for 10-12 minutes on medium heat.
            Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick or knife; it should come out clean.
            6. Serve
            Let the idlis cool slightly, then remove them from the molds with a spoon.
            Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or a sprinkle of podi with oil.
            Tips
            The batter can be stored in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.
            For extra softness, you can add a handful of poha (flattened rice) soaked with the rice before grinding.
            Enjoy your soft, fluffy idlis!</p>

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>1 cup rice (preferably parboiled rice or dosa rice)
            1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)
            2 tbsp chana dal (optional, for extra crispiness)
            1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds (optional, for flavor and fermentation)
            Salt to taste
            Oil or ghee for cooking</p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>1. Prepare the Batter
            Soak: Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) separately and soak them in water for 4-6 hours. Chana dal can be soaked with the rice.
            Grind: Drain the soaked ingredients and blend them separately to a smooth paste. Add a bit of water as needed to create a thick but pourable batter.
            Mix and Ferment: Combine the rice and dal pastes in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well. Cover and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly.
            2. Making the Dosas
            Stir the Batter: Stir the fermented batter gently. If it’s too thick, add a little water to get a pourable, pancake-batter consistency.
            Heat the Pan: Heat a flat, non-stick skillet or cast iron dosa pan over medium heat. Lightly grease it with a few drops of oil or ghee, then wipe with a paper towel.
            Pour the Batter: Pour a ladleful of batter in the center of the pan. Quickly spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin layer.
            Cook the Dosa: Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the edges turn golden and start to lift from the pan.
            Flip or Serve: If you prefer a crisp dosa, cook just one side. Otherwise, flip and cook the other side for a few seconds.
            3. Serving
            Serve the dosa hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or a potato filling (masala dosa style).
            
            Tips
            If the pan gets too hot, sprinkle a little water and wipe with a paper towel before making the next dosa.
            The batter can be stored in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.
            Enjoy your crispy, homemade dosa!</p>

        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>
            Step 1: Marinate the Meat or Vegetables
            In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice.
            Add the meat or vegetables, ensuring they are fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours (or overnight for more flavor).
            Step 2: Prepare the Rice
            Bring water to a boil with salt, bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon stick, and cardamom.
            Add soaked basmati rice and cook until it’s about 70-80% cooked (al dente).
            Drain and set aside.
            Step 3: Layer the Biryani
            In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee or oil and add half of the fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves.
            Spread the marinated meat or vegetables evenly in the pot.
            Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat or vegetables.
            Top with remaining fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves. Drizzle with saffron milk if using.
            Step 4: Dum Cooking (Sealing and Slow Cooking)
            Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid, or cover it with foil and then a lid.
            Cook on a low flame for 25-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse.
            Step 5: Serve
            Fluff up the biryani gently, garnish with extra fried onions, and serve hot with raita, salad, or a side of curry.
            Enjoy your flavorful, aromatic biryani!

            Water – 2 cups (for cooking rice)
            Salt – to taste</p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>Step 1: Cook the Rice
            Rinse the rice thoroughly under running water to remove excess starch.
            In a pot, add rice, 2 cups of water, and salt to taste.
            Bring to a boil, then cover and cook on low heat for about 15 minutes until rice is fully cooked and water is absorbed. (Alternatively, you can use a rice cooker.)
            Step 2: Cook the Dal
            Rinse the dal thoroughly. In a pressure cooker, add dal and 2 cups of water. Add turmeric powder and a pinch of salt.
            Cook for 3–4 whistles on medium heat until dal is soft and mushy. (Alternatively, cook in a pot until soft, adding more water if needed.)
            Once cooked, mash the dal lightly for a smoother consistency. Set aside.
            Step 3: Prepare the Tempering (Tadka)
            In a pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
            Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and green chili. Sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.
            Add ginger and garlic, and sauté until they turn golden brown.
            Add chopped tomatoes, a pinch of salt, and cook until tomatoes become soft and mushy.
            Pour the cooked dal into the pan and mix well. Adjust the consistency by adding a little water if needed. Let it simmer for a few minutes.
            Taste and adjust salt as needed.
            Step 4: Garnish and Serve
            Garnish the dal with fresh coriander leaves.
            Serve hot with the prepared rice.

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>1 liter full-fat milk
            1/2 cup fine vermicelli (seviyan)
            1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)
            1/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
            8-10 dates, chopped (preferably soft Medjool dates)
            10-12 almonds, slivered
            10-12 pistachios, slivered
            8-10 cashews, chopped
            8-10 raisins
            4-5 green cardamom pods, crushed
            1/4 teaspoon saffron strands (optional)
            1 tablespoon rose water or kewra water (optional, for aroma)
            </p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>Step 1: Toast the Nuts and Vermicelli
            Heat ghee in a large pan on medium heat.
            Add cashews, almonds, pistachios, and raisins. Fry until the nuts are golden and raisins are plump. Remove and set aside.
            In the same ghee, add the vermicelli and toast it on low heat until it turns golden brown. Be careful not to burn it. Remove and set aside.
            Step 2: Boil the Milk
            In a separate, heavy-bottomed pot, bring the milk to a boil.
            Lower the heat and let the milk simmer until it thickens slightly, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking.
            Step 3: Add Dates and Toasted Vermicelli
            Add the chopped dates and let them soften in the milk for a few minutes.
            Add the toasted vermicelli and let it cook in the milk until it becomes soft (about 5-7 minutes).
            Step 4: Add Sugar and Spices
            Add sugar, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron strands (if using).
            Stir well and continue to simmer for a few more minutes until the sugar dissolves and the flavors blend.
            Step 5: Add Fried Nuts and Rose Water
            Add the fried nuts and raisins back into the pot, stirring gently.
            Add rose water or kewra water if using, and mix well.
            Step 6: Serve
            Serve Sheer Kurma warm or chilled, garnished with extra nuts and saffron strands, if desired.

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>Ingredients
            For the Batter:
            1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
            1 tablespoon chickpea flour (besan)
            1/4 cup yogurt
            1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder (for color) or a few drops of yellow/orange food color (optional)
            1/2 teaspoon baking powder (optional, for extra crispiness)
            Water as needed
            For Sugar Syrup:
            1 cup sugar
            1/2 cup water
            1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
            1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
            A few saffron strands (optional)
            Rose water or kewra essence (optional, for aroma)
            For Frying:
            Ghee or oil
            </p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>Step 1: Prepare the Batter
            In a mixing bowl, combine flour, chickpea flour, yogurt, and turmeric powder or food color if using.
            Gradually add water and whisk until you have a smooth, lump-free batter with a consistency similar to pancake batter (not too runny or too thick).
            Cover and let the batter ferment for 6-8 hours or overnight in a warm place. If you want quicker results, you can skip fermentation and use baking powder in the batter just before frying.
            Step 2: Make the Sugar Syrup
            In a saucepan, add sugar and water, and bring it to a boil.
            Add cardamom powder, lemon juice, and saffron strands if using. Simmer until the syrup reaches a one-string consistency (when a small drop of syrup between your fingers forms a thin string).
            Add a few drops of rose water or kewra essence for aroma. Turn off the heat but keep the syrup warm.
            Step 3: Prepare for Frying
            Pour the fermented batter into a squeeze bottle, piping bag, or a plastic zip-lock bag with a small hole cut in one corner. This will help create the signature spiral shapes.
            Heat ghee or oil in a flat pan over medium heat. Test the oil by dropping a small amount of batter in it; it should sizzle and float up gradually without burning.
            Step 4: Fry the Jalebi
            Carefully squeeze the batter into the hot oil in spiral shapes, working from the center outward.
            Fry on medium-low heat until the jalebis are crisp and golden on both sides, about 1-2 minutes per side.
            Remove from the oil and immediately dip the jalebis in the warm sugar syrup for 10-15 seconds, making sure they are well-coated.
            Remove from the syrup and place them on a plate to cool slightly.
            Step 5: Serve
            Serve the jalebis warm, garnished with a sprinkle of chopped pistachios or saffron strands if desired.
            Enjoy your crispy, juicy, and delicious homemade Jalebi!</p>

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>6-8 slices of white bread (preferably a day or two old)
            2 cups milk
            1 cup sugar
            1/2 cup water
            1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter)
            A handful of cashews and almonds, sliced
            A few strands of saffron (optional, soaked in a tbsp of warm milk)
            1/2 tsp cardamom powder
            1/2 cup condensed milk (optional for extra richness)</p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>
            Prepare the Bread:
            
            Cut the bread slices into quarters or triangles.
            Heat a bit of ghee in a pan and fry the bread pieces until they’re golden brown. Alternatively, you can toast the bread if you want a lighter version.
            Make the Sugar Syrup:
            
            In a saucepan, add sugar and water. Bring it to a boil until the sugar dissolves completely. Add cardamom powder and remove from heat.
            Prepare the Milk Mixture:
            
            In another saucepan, heat the milk until it comes to a gentle boil. Add condensed milk (if using) and saffron. Stir well and simmer for 5 minutes.
            Assemble the Dessert:
            
            In a large baking dish, arrange the fried bread slices. Pour the sugar syrup over the bread, allowing it to soak in.
            Next, pour the milk mixture over the bread, ensuring all pieces are soaked.
            Garnish and Serve:
            
            Sprinkle sliced cashews and almonds on top.
            You can either serve this warm or bake it in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 10-15 minutes for a more baked texture.
            Enjoy!
            
            Double Ka Meetha is best served warm, with all those rich flavors absorbed into the bread. Enjoy this delightful treat!

        <h3 class="food-heading">Ingredients : </h3>
        <p>1 cup cashews (kaju)
            1/2 cup sugar
            1/4 cup water
            1/2 tsp cardamom powder (optional)
            1 tsp ghee (for greasing)
            Edible silver leaf (varak) for garnish (optional)</p>
        <h3 class="food-heading">Process :</h3>
        <p>Prepare the Cashew Powder:

            Grind the cashews into a fine powder. Be careful not to over-blend as it can release oil and turn into a paste. Sift the powder if there are lumps.
            Make the Sugar Syrup:
            
            In a pan, combine the sugar and water. Heat it over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely.
            Let it boil until you achieve a one-string consistency (when a drop of syrup between your fingers forms a single string).
            Add Cashew Powder:
            
            Lower the heat and add the cashew powder to the syrup. Stir continuously to prevent lumps.
            Add cardamom powder if using and continue to stir until the mixture thickens and starts coming together as a dough.
            Knead the Dough:
            
            Transfer the dough onto a greased surface and let it cool slightly.
            Grease your hands with a little ghee and knead the dough until smooth and pliable.
            Roll Out the Dough:
            
            Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out into a thin layer (about 3-4 mm thick).
            Peel off the top sheet of parchment and, if desired, place edible silver leaf on top.
            Cut into Diamonds:
            
            Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into diamond shapes.
            Serve and Enjoy:
            
            Let the Kaju Katli cool completely, then gently separate the pieces.
